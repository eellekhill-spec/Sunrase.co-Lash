  "faq": {
    "How long do lash extensions last?": "Lash extensions typically last 4-6 weeks with proper care, but we recommend getting fills every 2-3 weeks to maintain fullness as your natural lashes shed naturally.",
    "Does it hurt?": "No! The application is completely painless. Most clients find it so relaxing they fall asleep during the service.",
    "How long does it take?": "Full sets typically take 1.5-2.5 hours depending on the style. Fills usually take 45-90 minutes.",
    "Can I wear makeup?": "Yes, but avoid oil-based makeup and makeup removers. We recommend using lash extension-safe products.",
    "How do I prepare?": "Come with clean lashes (no makeup), and avoid caffeine before your appointment as it can make your eyes flutter.",
    "Classic vs Hybrid vs Volume?": "Classic gives a natural mascara look, Volume creates dramatic fullness, and Hybrid is a mix of both for a fuller but natural appearance.",
    "Do I need a patch test?": "We recommend a patch test if you have sensitive eyes or have never had lash extensions before.",
    "Can I swim?": "Yes, after the initial 24-hour curing period. Just be gentle and pat dry instead of rubbing.",
    "What if I'm not happy?": "Your satisfaction is our priority! Please let us know immediately and we'll work to make it right.",
    "Free consultation?": "Yes! We offer free consultations to discuss your desired look and answer any questions."
